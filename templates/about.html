			JSMusicDB is a webstandards based music library/music player to be used in conjuction to the scanner.py script that can run on a NAS, like any synology NAS.
		</p>
		<p>
			Any type of scanning script can be used as long as the output is a JSON file with a specific layout.
		</p>
		<p>
			JSMusicDB is in public beta. Any bugs found can be <a href="https://github.com/lucienimmink/JSMusicDB/issues" target="_blank">reported</a> but some features are already in scope.
		</p>
		<p>
			The following features are currently in scope:
			<ul>
				<li>Ability to create new playlists</li>
				<li>Import/export playlists</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			New NAS types can be added, but support for the development is needed; I only got a Synology NAS myself ;) If you want to help me to create a connection to your NAS type you can help me by sending over a little bit of money. If i can raise enough I can buy a new NAS to begin to work on the connection. Note: Addasoft is my handle on paypal, the ios appstore and the play store.
